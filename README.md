Small scripts, big impact entry for the Codecademy January challenge

Note: I don't normally code with Python, but I am currently learning the basics

This program is created to take a user input for a future event (name, date, time). Then it will begin a countdown that allows the user to quit by hitting 'q'
This is a basic MVP and can be built upon by possibly adding multiple events. Building upon this by displaying events by proximity 

Required installations:
pip install keyboard
